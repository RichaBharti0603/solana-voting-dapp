<b>Solana Voting DApp</b> <br>
A decentralized voting application built using Solana blockchain to securely handle voting transactions. This app allows users to vote and track votes in a tamper-proof manner using blockchain technology.

<b>Introduction</b>
This project is a simple voting DApp built on the Solana blockchain. It demonstrates how to use Solana's fast, secure, and low-cost infrastructure for decentralized applications. The app allows users to cast votes, increment or decrement a counter, and securely store votes on the blockchain.

<b>Features</b>
<b>Increment/Decrement Vote:</b> Users can increase or decrease the vote count.

<b>Secure & Transparent</b>: Voting data is stored on the Solana blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency.

<b>Decentralized</b>: No single entity can control the voting process. The app is powered by the community of users.

<b>Close Voting</b>: Voting can be closed at any time, ensuring that the system remains in control.

<b>Interact with Solana Blockchain</b>: The app interacts with the Solana blockchain using Anchor, a framework for Solana smart contracts.

<b>Voting Mechanism</b>:

<b>Increment</b>: A user can vote by increasing the counter.

<b>Decrement</b>: A user can also subtract from the counter if needed.

The vote counts are updated on the blockchain, making the system immutable and transparent.

<b>Smart Contracts</b>: The voting mechanism is implemented in Anchor, which is a framework for writing Solana smart contracts. The contract is responsible for managing the logic of incrementing and decrementing the vote counts.

<b>Decentralization</b>: Since the app runs on a blockchain, no central authority can modify the results, ensuring fair voting.
